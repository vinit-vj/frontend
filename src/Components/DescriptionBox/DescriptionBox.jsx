          An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell
          physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet
          rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce
          website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage
          shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.

          An e-commerce website is a digital storefront that allows buyers to
          shop for goods and sellers to offer products and services. It's a
          virtual space where customers can make selections and sellers can
          showcase products.
